**Abstract**

Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle with tasks requiring long-term memory, structured reasoning, or rapid adaptation to novel situations based on past experience. Standard recurrent architectures like LSTMs can capture temporal dependencies but face limitations in memory capacity and targeted information retrieval. To address this, we propose integrating a Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC), an external memory-augmented neural network, with a standard RL framework. Our DNC agent features a recurrent LSTM controller coupled with an external memory matrix accessed via attention-based read and write heads, incorporating mechanisms for sparse reading, usage-based allocation, and temporal linkage of memory slots. We evaluate our DNC-RL agent using an Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) on challenging procedural tasks, including procedurally generated mazes and an algorithmic repeat-copy task. Our preliminary (hypothetical) results indicate that the DNC agent achieves significantly improved sample efficiency, learning to solve complex mazes using approximately 40% fewer episodes than a comparable LSTM baseline. Furthermore, the DNC demonstrates superior performance on the algorithmic task requiring precise sequential memory manipulation. Visualization of memory access patterns suggests the agent learns structured strategies for information storage and retrieval. This work demonstrates the potential of memory-augmented architectures like the DNC to enhance the capabilities and learning speed of RL agents on tasks demanding robust memory and reasoning.

**1. Introduction**

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, from game playing [1, 2] to robotics [3]. However, many real-world problems involve long-term dependencies, require reasoning over structured information accumulated over time, or necessitate adaptation to dynamically changing environments. Standard deep RL agents often employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [4] or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) [5], within their policy or value networks to handle sequential observations. While effective at capturing short-to-medium term temporal patterns, these architectures implicitly store information within their fixed-size hidden state, which can become a bottleneck for tasks demanding large memory capacity, precise information retrieval, or manipulation of structured data [6].

Consider tasks like navigating a complex, previously unseen maze, following intricate instructions, or learning simple computer programs. Success in these domains hinges on the ability to store relevant information (e.g., maze layout, instruction steps, variable values) and retrieve it accurately when needed. Standard RNNs may struggle to selectively overwrite or access specific pieces of stored information without interference, limiting their effectiveness and sample efficiency on such tasks.

To overcome these limitations, memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) [7, 8] have been proposed. These models decouple computation (controller) from memory storage (external memory matrix), allowing for larger memory capacity and more flexible, targeted read/write operations via attention mechanisms. The Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) [8] is a prominent example, building upon the Neural Turing Machine (NTM) [7] with added mechanisms for tracking memory usage and the temporal order of writes.

This paper investigates the integration of a DNC architecture within a standard deep RL framework to tackle complex procedural tasks. We hypothesize that the DNC's explicit memory and structured access capabilities will enable RL agents to learn more efficiently and achieve better final performance compared to LSTM-based agents on tasks demanding robust memory utilization.

Our key contributions are:
*   An implementation of a DNC agent suitable for RL, incorporating sparse reads, usage-based memory allocation, and temporal link matrix updates.
*   Integration of the DNC with an Actor-Critic (A2C) [9] RL algorithm using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) [10].
*   Benchmarking the DNC-RL agent against a comparable LSTM baseline on a procedural maze navigation task and an algorithmic repeat-copy task.
*   (Hypothetical) Demonstration that the DNC agent achieves a significant sample efficiency improvement (target: ~40% fewer episodes) on the procedural maze task.
*   Qualitative analysis through visualization of the DNC's memory access patterns during task execution.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3 details the DNC architecture and its integration with RL. Section 4 describes the experimental setup. Section 5 presents and discusses our (hypothetical) results. Section 6 concludes and outlines future directions.

**2. Related Work**

Our work builds upon research in memory-augmented neural networks, reinforcement learning for sequential tasks, and procedural content generation.

*   **Memory in Neural Networks:** RNNs, particularly LSTMs [4] and GRUs [5], are the standard for sequence modeling, including in RL [11]. Their gating mechanisms allow them to maintain information over time, but their fixed-size hidden state limits capacity and explicit addressability [6]. Attention mechanisms [12] have enhanced sequence models but don't typically provide persistent external storage in the same way as MANNs.
*   **External Memory Architectures:** Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) [7] introduced the concept of a neural network controller interacting with external memory via differentiable read/write heads. Differentiable Neural Computers (DNCs) [8] extended NTMs with memory usage tracking for allocation and a temporal link matrix to track write order, enhancing performance on tasks requiring complex data structure manipulation (like graph traversal). Other related architectures include Memory Networks [13] and Neural GPUs [14]. While often evaluated on supervised learning tasks, their application within RL remains an active area. Some works have explored NTMs or simplified MANNs in RL contexts [15, 16], often finding benefits but also highlighting training challenges.
*   **RL for Sequential and Procedural Tasks:** Many RL benchmarks involve sequential decision-making [17]. Procedural Content Generation (PCG) in environments [18, 19], such as the maze task used here, provides a valuable testbed for generalization and requires agents to potentially store and reuse information across episodes or adapt quickly within an episode. Algorithmic tasks [7, 20] directly probe the ability of agents to learn program-like behaviors, heavily relying on precise memory operations. Standard RL algorithms like DQN [1], A2C [9], and PPO [21] are often combined with recurrent networks for these domains.
*   **Our Contribution:** This work focuses on a faithful implementation of the core DNC mechanisms (including usage, allocation, and temporal links) integrated directly into an online A2C RL loop. We specifically benchmark against a standard LSTM baseline on procedural tasks designed to stress memory capabilities, aiming to quantify the sample efficiency gains predicted by the DNC's architectural advantages. We also provide tools for visualizing the learned memory access strategies.

**3. Methodology: DNC-RL Agent**

We propose an RL agent whose policy and value functions are parameterized by a Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC). The agent interacts with the environment step-by-step using the A2C algorithm.

**3.1 DNC Architecture**

The DNC architecture, illustrated conceptually (see Figure 1 - *placeholder*), consists of a neural network controller (an LSTM cell in our implementation) and an external memory module `M` (a `N x M` tensor, where N is the number of memory slots and M is the vector size per slot). The controller interacts with the memory via differentiable read and write heads.

*   **Controller:** An LSTM cell receives the environment observation `x_t` concatenated with the read vectors `r_{t-1}` retrieved from memory at the previous step. It outputs a hidden state `h_t`, which is used to parameterize the memory interface and the agent's outputs.
    `h_t, c_t = LSTMCell([x_t, r_{t-1}^1, ..., r_{t-1}^{num\_reads}], (h_{t-1}, c_{t-1}))`

*   **Memory Module:** A tensor `M_t` of shape `(B, N, M)` (where B is the batch size) storing memory vectors. It is dynamically updated at each step.

*   **Read Heads:** We use `num_reads` read heads. Each head `i` computes read weights `w^r_{t,i}` (size N) based on the controller state `h_t`, the current memory `M_t`, previous read weights, and the temporal link matrix (though temporal reads are simplified in the current implementation, see Section 3.2). We employ *sparse content addressing*, using `sparse_softmax_topk` to focus the read weights on the top-`k` most relevant memory slots based on cosine similarity between a key emitted by the controller and the memory contents. The read vector `r_t^i` is the weighted sum of memory vectors: `r_t^i = (w^r_{t,i})^T M_t`.

*   **Write Head:** A single write head determines how to modify the memory. It calculates final write weights `w^w_t` (size N) by interpolating between content-based weights `w^c_t` (using cosine similarity and standard softmax) and allocation-based weights `w^a_t` (prioritizing unused slots). The interpolation is controlled by gates `g^a_t` and `g^w_t` emitted by the controller. The head also outputs an erase vector `e_t` and an add vector `a_t`. The memory is updated via:
    `M_t = M_{t-1} * (1 - outer(w^w_t, e_t)) + outer(w^w_t, a_t)`

**3.2 Memory Dynamics**

Crucial to the DNC are the mechanisms managing memory allocation and temporal dependencies:

*   **Usage Vector (`u_t`):** Tracks the "freeness" of each memory slot (size N). Updated based on current reads (`w^r_t`) and *previous* writes (`w^w_{t-1}`) using Eq. 8 from [8] (see `docs/MEMORY.md`). High usage discourages allocation.
*   **Allocation Weighting (`w^a_t`):** The write head calculates weights favoring slots with low usage, enabling writes to unused memory (see `docs/MEMORY.md`).
*   **Temporal Link Matrix (`L_t`):** An `N x N` matrix tracking write order (`L_t[i, j] ≈ 1` means `i` was written after `j`). Updated based on current write weights (`w^w_t`) and precedence weights (`p_t`) using Eq. 7 from [8]. Precedence weights `p_t` (size N) track the probability that a slot was the last one written to (Eq. 6 from [8]). These allow for reconstructing sequences stored in memory (though temporal reads are currently simplified).

**3.3 State Representation**

The full state of the DNC agent at time `t` includes the controller state `(h_t, c_t)` and the memory interface state: `{memory: M_t, read_weights: w^r_t, write_weights: w^w_t, usage: u_t, link_matrix: L_t, precedence_weights: p_t}`. This entire state dictionary is passed recurrently between time steps.

**3.4 RL Integration (A2C)**

The DNC model is trained end-to-end using the A2C algorithm.
*   **Outputs:** The controller hidden state `h_t` is passed through linear layers to produce policy logits (for a `Categorical` distribution over actions) and a state value estimate `V(s_t)`.
*   **Training Loop:** The agent interacts with the environment for `n_steps_update` steps, storing observations, actions, rewards, dones, log probabilities, and value estimates.
*   **GAE Calculation:** At the end of the `n_steps_update` rollout (or episode termination), Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) [10] is used to compute advantage estimates `A_t` and N-step returns `R_t`, using the collected rewards and value estimates.
*   **Loss Function:** The total loss comprises policy gradient loss, value function loss (MSE or Smooth L1), and an entropy bonus:
    `L = L_policy + c_v * L_value - c_e * L_entropy`
    `L_policy = - mean(A_t * log π(a_t|s_t))`
    `L_value = mean((R_t - V(s_t))^2)`
    `L_entropy = mean(Entropy(π(.|s_t)))`
*   **Optimization:** The loss is backpropagated through the entire DNC architecture (unrolled over the `n_steps_update` steps, implicitly), and gradients are clipped before applying an Adam [22] optimizer step. The DNC's state is carried over between updates within an episode but reset at the start of each new episode.

**4. Experimental Setup**

We evaluate the DNC-RL agent against an LSTM baseline on two types of tasks designed to require memory.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Procedural Maze (`ProceduralMazeEnv`):** A 2D maze navigation task where a new maze layout (e.g., 5x5 logical size) is generated for each episode using randomized Prim's algorithm. The agent receives a flattened grid observation (path, wall, agent, goal) and must navigate from a fixed start to a fixed goal. Rewards are sparse (+1 for goal, -0.01 per step). This tests spatial memory and exploration.
    *   **Repeat Copy (`RepeatCopyEnv`):** An algorithmic task where the agent observes a short binary sequence, a delimiter, and a repeat count R. It must then output the original sequence R times. This directly tests sequential memory storage, retrieval, and manipulation. Rewards are given per correct output bit.

*   **Baseline:** An LSTM-based agent with the same A2C training framework. The LSTM controller has the same hidden size as the DNC controller for a comparable number of core recurrent parameters.

*   **Training Details:** Both agents are trained using A2C with GAE as described in Section 3.4. Key hyperparameters (learning rate, gamma, lambda, entropy/value coefficients, memory dimensions for DNC) are specified in `configs/dnc.yaml` and `configs/lstm.yaml`. We use the Adam optimizer and gradient clipping. Training runs for 5000 episodes. (Note: Real experiments require multiple runs with different seeds).

*   **Evaluation Metrics:** We measure performance based on:
    *   Average episode reward (smoothed over 100 episodes).
    *   Average episode length.
    *   Number of episodes required to reach a predefined performance threshold (e.g., average reward > 0.8 on the maze).
    *   Accuracy or success rate on the RepeatCopy task.

*   **Implementation:** Models are implemented in PyTorch [23]. Environments use the Gymnasium [24] interface. Training progress is logged using TensorBoard.

**5. Results and Discussion**

*(Note: The following results are **hypothetical**, illustrating the expected outcomes based on the project goals and DNC's design.)*

**5.1 Quantitative Results**

*   **Procedural Maze:** Learning curves (Figure 2 - *placeholder*) show the average episode reward and length for DNC and LSTM agents. The DNC agent consistently achieves higher average rewards and learns significantly faster than the LSTM baseline. The LSTM agent exhibits slower improvement and plateaus at a lower performance level. Based on the criterion of reaching an average reward of 0.8 over 100 episodes, the DNC agent achieves this target in approximately 85 episodes (hypothetical), while the LSTM baseline requires around 142 episodes (hypothetical), supporting the target ~40% reduction in sample complexity (Table 1 - *placeholder*).

*   **Repeat Copy:** On the RepeatCopy task (Figure 3 - *placeholder*), the DNC agent quickly learns to reproduce the sequences accurately, achieving near-perfect accuracy. The LSTM baseline struggles significantly, especially with longer sequences or higher repeat counts, often failing to store the sequence correctly or losing track of the required repetitions. This highlights the DNC's advantage in tasks requiring precise, structured memory.

**5.2 Qualitative Results: Memory Visualization**

Visualizations of the DNC's memory access patterns (Figure 4 - *placeholder*, generated via `scripts/visualize.py`) provide insights into its learned strategy.
*   On the maze task, we observe the write head becoming active as new parts of the maze are explored, potentially storing spatial layout information. Read heads show focused access patterns when the agent needs to recall paths or navigate junctions. Usage patterns indicate that memory slots are allocated and reused over time.
*   On the RepeatCopy task, write patterns correspond to the input sequence presentation. During the output phase, read heads exhibit sequential access patterns corresponding to the sequence structure, demonstrating retrieval of the stored information. Usage remains relatively stable during output, indicating primarily read operations.

**5.3 Discussion**

The (hypothetical) results strongly suggest that the DNC's external memory provides a significant advantage over standard LSTMs for RL agents tackling tasks with substantial memory demands. The improved sample efficiency on the maze task indicates that explicitly storing and retrieving spatial information accelerates learning. The near-perfect performance on RepeatCopy underscores the DNC's capability for precise sequential data manipulation, a known weakness of standard RNNs.

The memory visualizations provide qualitative evidence that the DNC learns task-relevant memory access strategies, rather than simply using the memory randomly. The allocation mechanism appears effective in allowing the agent to write new information without immediately overwriting potentially useful older memories.

However, the DNC is not without drawbacks. It introduces significantly more parameters and computational overhead per step compared to the LSTM. Training can be sensitive to hyperparameters, particularly those related to the memory module and the RL algorithm itself. The current implementation also simplifies temporal read mechanisms, which might limit performance on tasks heavily reliant on recalling the exact order of past events.

**6. Conclusion and Future Work**

We presented a Differentiable Neural Computer integrated into an Actor-Critic RL framework (DNC-RL). Our implementation includes core DNC features like content and allocation-based addressing, usage tracking, and temporal links. Through experiments on procedural maze navigation and algorithmic sequence reproduction tasks, we demonstrated (hypothetically) that the DNC-RL agent significantly outperforms a comparable LSTM baseline in terms of sample efficiency and final performance, particularly when tasks require substantial memory capacity and structured information access. Visualization tools provide insights into the learned memory strategies.

This work suggests that incorporating external, addressable memory is a promising direction for enhancing deep RL agents. Future work includes:
*   Implementing and evaluating the full temporal read capabilities of the DNC.
*   Testing the DNC-RL agent on a wider range of complex tasks, including 3D navigation, robotics simulations, and program synthesis challenges.
*   Exploring the integration of DNCs with other RL algorithms like PPO [21] or SAC [25].
*   Conducting rigorous meta-learning experiments to explicitly test the DNC's ability to adapt faster to distributions of related tasks.
*   Investigating methods to reduce the computational cost and improve the stability of training DNC-RL agents.
*   Developing the ONNX export and ROS integration further for potential real-world deployment.
